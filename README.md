# E-Commerce
#This project implements a basic e-commerce system that models various product types and their interactions with customers. It provides a foundational understanding of object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance and class structures in the context of an online store.
#Customer management: Customers can be created with attributes like ID and name.
Product management: Products can be added with details like ID, name, price, and potentially category or type (electronic, book, clothing).
Shopping cart: Customers can add and remove products from their shopping cart.
Order processing: Orders can be placed with customer information and purchased products.
